** Installation
*** Requirements
To get things work out of the box you'll need:
- [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/][Nerd Fonts]] installed (here is used *Hack Nerd Font* as default)
- Firefox installed (it's used here as links browser)
- Linux OS (maybe, never tried this on Windows)

To install this config simply clone this repo to your home directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/VasKho/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

** Configuration
This repo comes with a lot of plugins with configs slightly different from defaults, so you can modify all files in the [[./lisp/config]] directory.

All the plugins aren't connected with each other, so +I hope+ it won't break anything.

*** Modeline configuration
To customize modeline you can use functions described in [[./lisp/config/modeline.el]] file.

- ~modeline--render~ takes two lists as arguments.

  The first is the left part, the second is the right part of the modeline.
  
  *!Note:* SIMPLE STRINGS DON'T WORK, LISTS ONLY
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq-default mode-line-format
                  '(:eval (modeline--render (list "%I %b") (list "%m %p"))))
  #+END_SRC

- ~modeline--create-segment~ is a convenient way to create segments with separators.
  
  The first argument is a content of segment, the second is a separator.
  
  The third argument is a list of colors with 3 elements. (<segment-foreground> <segment-background> <separator-background>)
  
  Return value is a list of propertized strings.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (modeline--create-segment " %b " "/" '("#fabd2f" "#3c3836" "#504945"))
    (modeline--create-segment " * " nil '("#fe8019" "#504945"))
    (modeline--create-segment nil "\\" '(nil "#504945" "#ebdbb2"))
  #+END_SRC

- ~modeline--get-icon~ is a function to get file name and extension and to return icon for the current file.
  
  To get more info about creating more entries you can simply read the [[file:./lisp/config/modeline.el::24][source]].
